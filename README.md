# Express TypeScript Template with Hot-Reload Support ðŸš€

Create your next Express app effortlessly with TypeScript and enjoy the smooth development experience of hot-reload functionality. ðŸ˜Ž

## Installation

Get started by running the following command to create a new project:

```bash
npx express-typescript-app <app-name>
```

## How It Works

This CLI tool automates the setup of a TypeScript-based Express application with hot-reloading capabilities using `nodemon`, ensuring your changes are reflected instantly during development.

### File Structure

After running the command, your project directory will look like this:

```
<app-name>/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/
